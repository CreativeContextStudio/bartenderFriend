Basic recipe knowledge for a modern bar = you can confidently make the core classics without looking, know the specs (ingredients + proportions + glassware + ice style + garnish), and can talk to guests about simple variations. Think “muscle memory + pattern recognition,” not encyclopedic mixology.

Below is a focused, practical guide plus a 7–10 day learning plan designed for someone who’s smart, rusty, and wants to look solid fast.

***

## 1. What “basic recipe knowledge” usually means

In a new, hip Atlanta bar/restaurant, “basic recipe knowledge” typically includes:

1. **Core families of drinks**
   - Sours: Margarita, Daiquiri, Whiskey Sour, Cosmopolitan
   - Spirit-forward: Old Fashioned, Manhattan, Negroni, Martini
   - Highballs: Gin & Tonic, Rum & Coke, Vodka Soda, Paloma, Moscow Mule
   - Collins/Fizz: Tom Collins, Vodka Collins
   - House riffs on these (e.g., spicy marg, flavored old fashioned)

2. **Standard specs**
   - Typical builds: 2 oz base spirit, ¾–1 oz citrus, ½–¾ oz sweetener, etc.
   - When to shake vs stir
   - When to serve up vs rocks vs long/Collins
   - Common garnishes (lime wedge vs wheel, orange peel, cherry)

3. **Basic product and modifier knowledge**
   - Vermouth (sweet vs dry), triple sec/Cointreau, amaro, Campari, simple syrup, agave, grenadine, bitters.
   - Dry vs dirty martini; up vs rocks; neat vs on the rocks vs with a back.

4. **Beer, wine, and N/A basics**
   - General styles (IPA vs lager vs stout, red vs white vs rosé).
   - At least 2–3 simple N/A builds (Virgin Mojito, Seedlip tonic, N/A mule, etc., depending on the program).

If you can walk in and comfortably make ~20–30 classics from memory and understand the patterns, you’ll read as “has basic recipe knowledge” and everything else you can learn on the job.

## 2. Core specs cheat-sheet (the “I actually know what I’m doing” set)

Think in **templates** more than individual recipes. Below are standard, widely used specs; the actual bar might tweak them, but this gives you a solid foundation.

### 2.1 Sour template (shaken, citrusy, crowd-pleasers)

**Generic Sour template**
- 2 oz base spirit
- ¾ oz fresh lemon or lime
- ¾ oz simple syrup (1:1) or equivalent sweetener
- Shake hard with ice, strain
- Glass: Coupe (up) or rocks (on ice)
- Garnish: Citrus wheel/wedge or peel

**Examples**  
Margarita (classic-ish build)
- 2 oz tequila (blanco)
- 1 oz lime
- ¾ oz triple sec (or Cointreau)
- ¼ oz agave or simple (optional, depending on how sweet they want it)
- Shake, strain over fresh ice in rocks glass (or up); salt rim optional
- Garnish: Lime wheel

Daiquiri
- 2 oz light rum
- 1 oz lime
- ¾ oz simple syrup
- Shake, strain into coupe (no ice)
- Garnish: Lime wheel

Whiskey Sour (no egg white version)
- 2 oz bourbon
- ¾ oz lemon
- ¾ oz simple syrup
- Shake, strain into rocks glass over ice (or up)
- Garnish: Cherry + orange slice or lemon peel (depending on house style)

Cosmopolitan
- 1½ oz vodka (citrus vodka if house does that)
- 1 oz Cointreau
- ½–¾ oz lime
- ½–1 oz cranberry (just enough for color + tartness)
- Shake, strain into martini glass
- Garnish: Lime wheel or orange peel

Spicy Margarita (house riff pattern)
- Start with margarita spec
- Add muddled jalapeño or a dash of chili tincture/spicy syrup
- Same shake/strain and garnish concepts

Memorize the **sour template** and you can reconstruct tons of menu drinks on the fly.

***

### 2.2 Spirit-forward template (stirred, boozy, silky)

**Generic “boozy, stirred” template**
- 2 oz base spirit
- 1 oz modifier(s)
- Stir with ice 20–30 seconds
- Strain into coupe or rocks (depending on style)
- Garnish with peel or cherry

Negroni
- 1 oz gin
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 1 oz Campari
- Stir, rocks glass over large ice
- Garnish: Orange peel

Old Fashioned (modern spec)
- 2 oz bourbon or rye
- ¼–½ oz simple syrup or 1 sugar cube
- 2–3 dashes Angostura bitters
- Stir with ice, serve over large cube in rocks glass
- Garnish: Orange peel, cherry optional (depending on house)

Manhattan
- 2 oz rye or bourbon
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 2 dashes Angostura
- Stir, strain into coupe
- Garnish: Cherry

Martini (house styles vary)
- “Dry” classic: 2½ oz gin or vodka, ½ oz dry vermouth  
- Stir (or shake if requested), strain into martini glass
- Garnish: Lemon twist or olives (dirty martini = add olive brine)

If you know these, you can handle 90% of “classic but boozy” orders.

***

### 2.3 Highballs and simple builds (speed + volume)

Highballs are where speed and confidence matter.

Core pattern:
- 1½–2 oz spirit
- Build in tall glass over ice
- Top with mixer, quick garnish, no fuss

Examples:
- Gin & Tonic: 1½–2 oz gin, top tonic in Collins glass, lime wedge
- Vodka Soda: 1½–2 oz vodka, top soda, lime wedge
- Rum & Coke: 1½–2 oz rum, top cola, lime optional
- Paloma: 2 oz tequila, ~½ oz lime, top grapefruit soda (Jarritos/Squirt), salt rim optional
- Moscow Mule: 2 oz vodka, ½ oz lime, top ginger beer, copper mug/rocks, lime garnish

If you can free-pour these and keep moving, you’ll feel back in rhythm fast.

***

### 2.4 Collins/Fizz and light, refreshing drinks

Tom Collins
- 2 oz gin
- ¾ oz lemon
- ¾ oz simple
- Shake with ice, strain into Collins glass with fresh ice
- Top with soda
- Garnish: Lemon wheel + cherry (if house does that)

Vodka Collins
- Same as Tom Collins but with vodka

These are essentially “sour + soda in a tall glass.”

***

### 2.5 N/A go-tos (modern expectation)

Have 2–3 simple non-alcoholic builds in your pocket:

- Virgin Mojito: Muddle lime + mint + simple, add ice, top soda
- N/A Mule: Lime, ginger beer, maybe a dash of bitters (if guest is ok with trace alcohol)
- Fancy soda: Grenadine + lemon + soda (“Shirley Temple” vibe)

Bars will often have their own N/A list; your “basic knowledge” is just knowing how to build something that doesn’t suck if someone asks off-menu.

***

## 3. Bar language and workflow refresher

### 3.1 Key terms you need to be sharp on again

- Neat: Spirit in glass, no ice.
- Rocks: Over ice.
- Up: Chilled and strained, no ice in the glass.
- Dry/extra dry: Less vermouth; sometimes just rinsed glass.
- Dirty: Olive brine added (martinis).
- Twist: Citrus peel (lemon/orange) as garnish.
- Double: Generally double the spirit (often in bigger glass or with more ice).

### 3.2 When to shake vs stir (rule of thumb)

- **Shake**: Anything with citrus, juice, egg white, dairy, or cloudy ingredients.
- **Stir**: Clear-only drinks (spirits + liqueurs + vermouth, etc.).

***

## 4. Quick learning plan (7–10 days)

Design is “minimal time, maximum confidence.” Assume 45–60 minutes per day, plus any extra reps you want.

### Day 1–2: Core templates + flashcards

Goal: Get the **patterns** in your head.

1. **Write or type a one-page cheat sheet**:
   - Sour template + 4 examples (Margarita, Daiquiri, Whiskey Sour, Cosmo).
   - Stirred template + 3 examples (Old Fashioned, Manhattan, Negroni).
   - Highball patterns + 4 examples (G&T, Vodka Soda, Rum & Coke, Mule).
2. Make **flashcards** (physical or digital):
   - Front: “Margarita” → Back: Ingredients, ounces, glass, ice, garnish.
   - Same for ~20–25 drinks.
3. Run 10–15 minutes of rapid drills:
   - Flip card, say spec **out loud** as if calling the drink on the line.

### Day 3–4: Physical reps at home (no alcohol required)

Goal: Rebuild muscle memory.

1. Use a shaker, mixing glass, jigger (or measuring cup if you don’t have bar tools yet).
2. Practice:
   - Building 3–4 sours in a row (just using water + food coloring or similar).
   - Stirring boozy drinks in a mixing glass with ice.
   - Straining: Hawthorne vs fine strainer if you have one.
3. Practice **workflow**:
   - Imagine a ticket: “Margarita, Old Fashioned, Vodka Soda.”
   - Decide: what gets built/shaken/stirred first, how to batch motions.
   - Physically move as if you’re behind a line.

### Day 5–6: Menu simulation + script

Goal: Talk like a bartender again.

1. Write a fake but plausible menu section for a “hip Atlanta bar”:
   - 3 house cocktails (a spicy marg riff, a mezcal Negroni variant, a seasonal sour).
   - 2 spirit-forward drinks.
   - 2 N/A drinks.
2. For each:
   - Map back to the core templates (“This is basically a sour with X instead of Y.”)
3. Practice **guest interaction scripts**:
   - Explaining a Negroni vs an Old Fashioned.
   - Recommending something “not too sweet” or “more spirit-forward.”
   - Handling “Surprise me: I like tequila and citrus but not too sweet.”

You can literally stand in your kitchen and run this as a role-play for 10–15 minutes.

### Day 7–10: Tighten memory + speed

Goal: Be plug-and-play ready.

1. Daily “20-drink sprint”:
   - Randomly choose 20 classics and recite specs, build, glass, and garnish.
2. Practice **order of operations**:
   - Always build the “up” and shaken drinks before rocks if you can, so they stay cold but not diluted.
   - Group by build: do all shaken drinks, then stirred, then simple highballs.
3. If you have a friend/partner:
   - Have them “ring in” fake orders rapid-fire and you call out builds.

***

## 5. Day-one-on-the-job checklist

When you actually start (or at the working interview/trial shift), focus on:

1. **Ask for the house spec sheet** (most places have at least a basic one).
   - Confirm: house Old Fashioned/Margarita/Negroni/Martini specs.
   - Ask which classics the bar team considers “must know.”
2. **Lock down their version of:**
   - Marg, Old Fashioned, Martini, Negroni, Mojito, Mule.
3. **Watch the fastest bartender on shift**
   - Note how they:
     - Set up their station.
     - Batch motions (grabs all citrus at once, etc.).
     - Communicate with guests while building drinks.

Your previous bar/club/event experience will snap back quickly once you’re in the environment; the key is walking in with **enough core specs** that you aren’t in your head.

***

## 6. Minimal “cheat-sheet” list to memorize cold

If you want a very short “must know by heart” list, use this:

- Margarita
- Daiquiri
- Whiskey Sour
- Cosmopolitan
- Old Fashioned
- Negroni
- Manhattan
- Martini (house gin + vodka versions, dry vs dirty)
- Gin & Tonic
- Vodka Soda
- Rum & Coke
- Moscow Mule
- Tom Collins
- Paloma
- At least 2 N/A builds

If you’d like, a follow-up can be a **one-page printable cheat sheet** in your preferred format (e.g., tightly formatted text you can copy to Notes / Notion) with just drink → spec → glass → garnish for quick cramming.
