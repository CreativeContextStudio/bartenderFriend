---

## PART 1: INTERVIEW PREP (Getting the Job)

### Pre-Interview Mindset
You've already bartended, waited, and worked events—that's your strength. The interviewer wants to know:
1. Can you execute the basics without hesitation?
2. Are you reliable and coachable?
3. Can you handle the pace of a "hip Atlanta bar/restaurant"?
4. Will you fit the team culture?

**Your pitch (30 seconds):**
"I've got 20 years of bar and hospitality experience—bartending, serving, event production. I'm back in the game and ready to execute. I know the classics, I pick up house specs fast, and I'm a quick learner in a busy environment. I'm here to be reliable and nail the fundamentals."

---

### Interview Questions & Strategic Answers

#### A. Experience & Motivation

**Q: "Why are you getting back into bartending after 20 years?"**

"I've been in creative/tech work, but I appreciate the direct-service, fast-paced environment. I want to be part of a solid team again, make good money on a flexible schedule, and honestly, I enjoy the craft and the people. I'm at a point where I want reliable income and the energy of a busy bar appeals to me."

---

**Q: "What types of bars have you worked in before?"**

"I've done full-service bartending at [venue type], event bars, club environments—so I'm comfortable with high-volume, complex orders, and team coordination. I also worked as a server and in event production, so I understand the full hospitality flow."

---

#### B. Drink Knowledge & Technical Skill

**Q: "Tell us about your basic recipe knowledge. Can you walk me through how you'd make [Margarita / Old Fashioned / Martini]?"**

**Margarita:** "2 oz tequila, 1 oz lime, ¾ oz triple sec—shake hard with ice, strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice. Salt rim if they want it. Lime wheel garnish."

**Old Fashioned:** "2 oz bourbon or rye, ¼ to ½ oz simple syrup, 2-3 dashes Angostura bitters. Stir for about 20-30 seconds with ice, strain into a rocks glass with a large ice cube. Orange peel for garnish."

**Martini:** "2½ oz gin (or vodka, depending on preference), ½ oz dry vermouth. Stir with ice for 20+ seconds—you want it cold and silky. Strain into a coupe glass. Lemon twist or olives if they prefer dirty."

*(Key: Say it out loud, confidently, without hesitation. Don't look unsure.)*

---

**Q: "What's the difference between shake and stir?"**

"You shake drinks with citrus, juice, egg whites, or anything cloudy—anything that needs aeration or mixing thoroughly. You stir clear drinks—spirits plus liqueurs or vermouth. Shake = chilled and mixed; stir = silky and diluted just right."

---

**Q: "How do you manage multiple orders during a rush?"**

"I prioritize based on what I can build efficiently. I'd do all my shaken drinks first—get those going in the shaker—while simultaneously building or starting any stirred cocktails. I batch similar drinks when possible. I also communicate with any barback or other bartender about timing if we're slammed. The key is staying calm and keeping visual track of what ticket I'm on."

---

#### C. Responsibility & Maturity

**Q: "How would you handle a customer who's clearly had too much to drink?"**

"I'd politely suggest they switch to water or food, and I'd talk to management immediately. We have a responsibility not to serve someone to the point of impairment. I'd do it respectfully—no confrontation—and let management handle the next step."

---

**Q: "How do you handle a customer complaint about a drink? E.g., they send it back twice."**

"First, I'd ask what's wrong—too strong, too sweet, wrong temperature. I'd listen, not get defensive. If it's my error, I own it. If I remake it and they're still not happy, I'd offer a different drink altogether or suggest water/NA. If they're just difficult, I'd flag management. The goal is solving it, not winning an argument."

---

**Q: "Are you comfortable working nights, weekends, and holidays?"**

"Absolutely. I understand that's when hospitality happens. I'm reliable—if I commit to shifts, I show up. Tell me what the schedule looks like and I'll be clear about my availability."

*(This is a reliability check. Answer with a yes, not maybes.)*

---

**Q: "Have you had any alcohol safety training (like TIPS or ServSafe Alcohol)?"**

"I have [if you do: certifications]. If not: "I haven't recently, but I understand responsible service and I'm happy to take any required training your place requires."

*(Many newer bars require this. Show willingness, not ignorance.)*

---

#### D. Culture Fit

**Q: "What do you know about this bar/restaurant? What drew you here?"**

"I looked at your menu online, read some reviews, and I like that you're in [neighborhood] doing [style of drinks/food]. It seems like the kind of place that values craft but keeps things approachable. That appeals to me."

*(Do 10 minutes of homework: check their website, Instagram, Google reviews. Mention something specific.)*

---

**Q: "What's your favorite cocktail to make and why?"**

"I like making a solid Old Fashioned because it's simple but you can see immediately if you've got the technique right. There's no hiding behind fancy tricks—it's about balance, a clean stir, and respect for the base spirit. Or, [pick a classic you're comfortable with], because [reason tied to technique or customer satisfaction]."

---

#### E. Questions You Should Ask Them

**Before they finish the interview, ask:**

1. "What does a typical shift look like here? How busy does it get, and what time frame?"
2. "What's your house spec for classics like the Margarita and Old Fashioned?"
3. "Do you have training on your POS system, or is that something you do onsite?"
4. "What does the team look like—am I working with a barback, another bartender?"
5. "What's the dress code?"

*(This shows you're thinking operationally, not just hoping for the gig.)*

## PART 2: A DAY-IN-THE-LIFE SHIFT BREAKDOWN

A typical shift at a modern upscale Atlanta bar/restaurant:

### OPENING SHIFT (Assume 4–5 PM opening)

**30–45 minutes before opening (3:30–4:15 PM)**

Your job: **Mise en place** (French for "everything in its place"). The bar must be ready to execute the moment the door opens.

**Walk-Through Checklist:**

1. **Station Setup**
   - Clear, organized bartop
   - All glassware clean and within reach (highballs, rocks, coupes, martini, Collins, shot glasses)
   - Shaker, bar spoon, jigger, Hawthorne strainer, fine strainer, muddler, channel knife visible and ready
   - Ice bin full of fresh ice
   - Garnish trays prepped: citrus wheels/wedges (lime, lemon, orange), olives, cherry

2. **Speed Rail & Liquor**
   - Most-used spirits at arm's reach: vodka, gin, rum, tequila, bourbon
   - Vermouth (dry and sweet), Cointreau, Campari, bitters lined up
   - All bottles clean and facing forward (labels out)
   - Bottle pourers installed on all liquor

3. **Mixers & Syrups**
   - Simple syrup, agave, grenadine all prepped and in dispensers
   - Soda gun tested (water, soda, ginger beer, tonic, cola—know each button)
   - Fresh lemon juice and lime juice squeezed (or pre-prepped if house does it)
   - Canned/bottled mixers chilled

4. **Beer & Wine** (if you're serving these)
   - Beer taps cleaned and flowing correctly
   - Wine by the glass at correct temp
   - Beer fridge stocked

5. **POS & Cash**
   - POS terminal powered on and responsive
   - Drawer unlocked with starting cash (ask manager for amount; usually $100–200)
   - Receipt paper loaded

6. **Secondary Stations**
   - Bartools wiped down
   - Napkins, coasters, water glasses at bar
   - Music volume appropriate (usually lower during service start)
   - Lighting set to "service mode"

7. **Safety & Compliance**
   - No broken glassware
   - No spills or wet spots on floor
   - Register area clean and safe

**Moment of truth:** Do a 2-minute visual scan. Would you feel confident serving drinks in this setup? If not, fix it.

---

### MAIN SERVICE (5 PM – Close)

**First hour (5–6 PM): Early-bird pace**

- Smaller crowd, more exploratory orders
- Guests arriving for early dinner or happy hour
- **Your job:** Execute cleanly, engage with customers, build confidence
- **Mindset:** This is where you rebuild your muscle memory. Be smooth, not rushed

**Expected drinks:**
- Highballs (G&T, Vodka Soda, Rum & Coke)
- Light cocktails (Margarita, Daiquiri, house special)
- Beer, wine, N/A drinks

---

**Peak Service (6–9 PM): The Rush**

- Full bar, tables filling, energy up
- Multiple tickets coming in simultaneously
- Servers placing drink orders for tables
- Guests at the bar ordering directly

**Your strategy in a rush:**

1. **Read the tickets quickly** – scan what needs to be made
2. **Prioritize efficiently:**
   - Build all rocks drinks first (they can sit on ice without degrading)
   - Then shake all sours together (batch them)
   - Then make any stirred drinks (martinis, Negronis)
   - Then simple highballs (fastest)
3. **Communicate constantly:**
   - To servers: "4 minutes on that margarita order"
   - To barback/other bartender: "I need ice, limes prepped, garnish check"
   - To guests waiting: "You're up next, what can I make you?"
4. **Maintain station hygiene** – even in chaos:
   - Don't let rinse bucket overflow
   - Keep jiggers and spoon within reach
   - Wipe spills immediately (slip hazard + looks sloppy)
5. **Stay calm and breathe** – you've done this before

**Common rush-time mistakes to avoid:**
- Leaving incomplete drinks on the bar (other bartender might grab them)
- Free-pouring without checking (consistency matters)
- Forgetting garnishes (guests notice, servers come back)
- Not communicating (everyone's confused, things take longer)

---

**Late Service (9 PM – Close: varies)**

- Crowd tapers, may shift toward late-night drinking or bar-only guests
- More craft orders, custom requests, repeat customers becoming familiar
- Slightly slower pace but still focused
- **Your job:** Maintain quality, manage tabs, prepare for close

---

### CLOSING DUTIES (Last 30–60 minutes)

When last call is announced and the final customers are finishing:

**Immediate tasks:**

1. **Stop accepting new orders** – at call time, close the register for new drinks
2. **Finish current orders** – complete what's on the bar, not new requests
3. **Begin station breakdown** (while still behind bar if customers are present):
   - Wipe down bar top
   - Empty garnish trays, store prepped citrus in walk-in
   - Remove pouring spouts from liquor bottles, place caps back on
   - Place liquor bottles back in secure storage (per house policy)
   - Drain ice bins; dispose of ice; sanitize bins

4. **Glassware & Equipment:**
   - All glasses go through dishwasher or hand-wash (no chips/cracks allowed; toss those)
   - All metal bar tools (shaker, spoon, strainers) washed and dried
   - Bar mats washed; hang to dry
   - Rinse buckets emptied and sanitized

5. **Soda Gun & Taps:**
   - Soda gun lines flushed (run water through each button)
   - Beer taps cleaned with water
   - Record any kegs that need changing for next shift

6. **Restocking for tomorrow:**
   - Fresh ice made and ready for opening shift
   - Garnishes prepped (if house does this at close vs. opening—ask)
   - Liquor inventory checked; alert manager if anything is low or needs reordering
   - Canned mixers, bottled beer restocked in fridges

7. **Cash Out:**
   - Count cash in your drawer (should match tickets rung in)
   - Separate tips from till (your take)
   - Manager verifies and records deposit
   - You pocket your tips or they go to a shared tip pool (varies by place)

8. **Final Walkthrough:**
   - Check under bar stools for spilled change or forgotten items
   - Wipe down bar one more time
   - All bottles stored correctly
   - Floor swept (or note for next cleaning crew)
   - Lights off, music off
   - Confirm all doors locked

**Time estimate:** 45 minutes to 1.5 hours depending on how busy the shift was.

### SHIFT LENGTH & COMPENSATION

**Atlanta bartender shifts typically:**
- Run 5–6 hours on slow nights
- Run 6–8 hours on peak nights (Friday–Saturday)
- Pay: $2.13/hr base (server minimum) + tips (your real income)
- Expected tips: 15–20% of drinks sold (good nights: $100–200+; quiet nights: $40–80)

**Typical shift schedule:**
- Tuesday–Thursday: 5 PM–11 PM or 5 PM–12 AM
- Friday–Saturday: 5 PM–1 AM or 5 PM–2 AM (depends on bar)
- Sundays: 5 PM–11 PM or closed

---

### WHAT TO BRING TO YOUR FIRST SHIFT

1. **Government-issued ID** (you'll need to verify your bartending certification if they require one)
2. **Dark pants** (no holes), **closed-toe shoes** (non-slip is better), **black or white top** (depends on dress code; ask)
3. **Hair tie** if you have longer hair (pulled back)
4. **Notepad & pen** (to jot down drink orders if the bar doesn't use POS screens)
5. **Phone** (for emergencies, but keep it silent and in your pocket)
6. **Positive attitude** and your cheat sheet (for the first few shifts)

---

### RED FLAGS DURING INTERVIEW OR FIRST SHIFT

**If you notice these, think twice about the role:**

- Dirty, disorganized bar station
- Unfriendly staff or hostile vibe
- Manager who seems disorganized or dismissive of questions
- Bar specs that are wildly off-standard (e.g., they want 3 oz of spirit in a Margarita—that's sloppy)
- No clear closing procedures or expectations
- Vague about pay structure or tips (good places are transparent)

**These suggest management is loose, shortcuts are common, and your experience will suffer.**

---

### MINDSET FOR SUCCESS IN FIRST 2 WEEKS

1. **Execute the basics perfectly** – don't try to innovate
2. **Ask questions** – "Where's the bitters?" is better than guessing wrong
3. **Batch similar drinks** – this builds rhythm back fast
4. **Engage with guests** – small talk, remember a name, remember their drink
5. **Be reliable** – show up on time, don't call out, follow through
6. **Observe the veterans** – note how they move, what they prioritize
7. **Stay sober** – no drinking during or after your shift while on the job
8. **Tip out fairly** – if there's a barback or support staff, tip them 1–2% of your take (standard practice)

After 2 weeks, muscle memory returns. After a month, you'll feel like you never left.

### QUICK FAQ: Questions You Might Have

**Q: What if I don't know a drink someone orders?**  
A: "I'm not familiar with that one—can you describe it to me, or would you like me to make you something I know well?" Or ask the manager/senior bartender nearby. Never guess.

**Q: What if I mess up a drink and they complain?**  
A: Apologize, take it back, remake it immediately, don't charge them. Move on. It happens to everyone.

**Q: How do I handle a drunk customer?**  
A: Politely offer water or food. Alert your manager immediately. Don't argue. Management calls the shots on whether to keep serving.

**Q: What if the POS system is unfamiliar?**  
A: Ask for a 10-minute tutorial during a quiet moment. Most systems are intuitive: find drink, select modifiers, hit send. Practice 3–4 times and you're good.

**Q: Do I need to memorize the entire menu?**  
A: Know the classics by heart, know the house specials inside-out, and be able to describe any drink on the menu. That's enough for week one.

**Q: What if I'm slower than the other bartender?**  
A: Don't panic. You're rebuilding. You'll catch up by week 3–4. Efficiency comes with reps.

**You've got this. You have 20 years of hospitality in your bones. The first night might feel rusty, but by night three you'll be surprised how much comes back.**
